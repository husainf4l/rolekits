# Shared Resources

Place cross-cutting assets here that are consumed by both the frontend and backend:

- Type definitions and JSON schemas
- Shared utility scripts
- Documentation snippets or markdown fragments

During Phase 1 this folder acts as a placeholder so that future phases can align on a single source of truth for shared artifacts.
